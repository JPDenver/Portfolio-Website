				<p>For me it's really time to take my problem solving and analytical thinking skills
				to the next level. I've always been a very creative problem solver and not one to 
				just let things be. If there's a problem with something new to me I thrive on 
				figuring it out until I understand it myself and can learn how to fix it.
